# NPCDebuffModifier
 
This plugin increases NPC debuff damage based off configuration.
It currently does not support decreasing debuff damage, only increasing.

Config explanation:
Buffs: First number is the buff ID, second number is the amount of damage to add.
BuffTimerInMilliseconds: The amount of time between intervals of applying the damage.
OilDamageMultiplier: Multiplies the damage of fire buffs (https://terraria.gamepedia.com/Oiled) when an NPC is oiled.
